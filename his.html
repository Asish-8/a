<!-- <p class="sm">Questions And Answers</p>
<p class="xsm bold">Q1) What Are The social,economic and political conditions in Russia Before 1905 ?</p>
<p class="xsm">Ans1) The Social , Economic And political conditions In Russia Was Backward: 
<ul class="xsm" style="margin-left: 4vw;">
  <li><span class="bold">Social Condition:</span>The majority religion was Russian Orthodox Christianity – which had grown out of the Greek Orthodox Church. But the empire also included Catholics, Protestants, Muslims and Buddhists. The non-Russian nationalities were not treated equal to that of Russian nationalities. They were not given freedom to follow their culture and language. Workers were a divided group on the basis of skill and training. Peasants formed their groups called commune or mir.</li><br>
  <li><span class="bold">Economic Condition:</span>Majority of the Russians were agriculturists. Grain was the main item of export from Russia. Industries were few. Prominent industrial areas were St. Petersburg and Moscow. Much of the production was done by the craftsmen. There were large factories alongside the craft workshops. With the expansion of the Russian rail network, foreign investment in factories grew. There was huge coal, Iron and Steel production. There were equal numbers of factory workers and craftsmen. The workers were exploited by the capitalists who made their life miserable.</li><br>
  <li><span class="bold">Political Condition:</span>Russia was a monarchy. Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia and its empire that extended to current day Finland, Lativia, Lithuania, Estonia, parts of Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. It stretched to the Pacific and comprised today’s Central Asian states, as well as Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The Tsars believed in the divine rights of kings. They were not responsible to the parliament. All political parties were illegal in Russia.</li><br>
</ul>

</p>
<p class="xsm bold">Q2) In what ways was the working population in Russia different from other countries in Europe, before 1917?</p>
<p class="xsm">Ans2) The working population in Russia was different from other countries in Europe, before 1917, in the following ways –
  <ol type="a" class="xsm"  style="margin-left: 4vw;">
<li>Vast majority of Russians were agriculturalists. This proportion was higher than in most European countries. In France and Germany this proportion was between 40% and 50%.</li>
<li>The cultivators in Russia produced for the markets as well as for their own needs.</li>
<li>Workers were a divided social group on the basis of skill. Metal workers considered themselves aristocrats among other workers as their occupation demanded more training and skills.</li>
<li>Peasants in Russian had no respect for the nobility. Nobles got their power and position through the Tsar and not through the local popularity, whereas in countries like France, peasants respected nobles.</li>
<li>In Russia, peasants had pooled their land together and divided the profits according to the family needs. In other parts of the world, agriculture was done individually by the peasants.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p class="xsm bold">Q3) Why did the Tsarist autocracy in Russia collapse in 1917?
</p>
<p class="xsm">
  <ol type="a" class="xsm"  style="margin-left: 4vw;">
  <li>Anti-German sentiments in Russia were high owing to the First World War. Further, Tsarian Alexandra’s German origin and poor advisors made the autocracy unpopular.</li><br>
  <li>Russia suffered shocking defeats on the warfront with millions of casualties. Crops and buildings were destroyed by the Russian army to prevent enemy having any advantage. It led to millions of refugees. Tsar was being cursed for this situation.</li><br>
  <li>Food shortage led to people rioting for food. The Russian army too shifted its loyalty and began supporting the revolutionaries.</li><br>
  <li>A lockout took place at a factory on the right bank of Neva river in sympathy with the workers on the left bank on 22nd February. Women led the strikes.</li><br>
  <li>Later, the government suspended the Duma which resulted in sharp protests. The demonstrators ransacked the Police head Quarters. The government called the cavalry but they refused to fire on the demonstrators.</li><br>
  <li>Soldiers and the striking workers gathered to form a ‘soviet’ or ‘Council’. This was the Petrograd Soviet.</li><br>
  <li>The very next day, when a delegation went to the Tsar, the military commanders advised the Tsar to abdicate. Soviet leaders and Duma leaders formed a provisional government to run the country. The Tsarist autocracy thus collapsed in 1917.</li><br>
    </ol>
  </p>
<p class="xsm bold">Q4) Make two lists: one with the main events and effects of the February Revolution and the other with the main events and effects of the October Revolution. Write a paragraph on who was involved in each, who were the leaders and what the impact of each was on Soviet history.</p>
<p class="xsm">Ans. <br>
  <p class="xsm bold text-center"> February Revolution: </p>
  <br>
  <p class="xsm bold text-center">EVENTS:</p> <br><br>
  <p class="xsm">In the winter of 1917, the situation in Petrograd was grim. There was food shortage in the worker’s quarters. </p>
<ol class="xsm" type="a" style="margin-left: 4vw;">
  <li>22 February: Lock out took place at a factory. Workers of factories joined in sympathy. Women also led and participated in the strikes. This came to be called the International Women’s Day.

  <li>27 February: The police headquarters were ransacked. Cavalry was called out again. An officer was shot at the barracks of a regiment and other regiments mutinied, voting to join the striking workers gathered to form a Soviet or Council. This was the Petrograd Soviet. A delegation went to meet the Tsar. The military commanders advised him to abdicate.</li>
  <li>2 March: The Tsar was abdicated.
    A provisional government was formed by the Soviet and Duma leaders to run the country.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p class="text-center xsm bold">EFFECTS:</p>
<ol class="xsm" type="a" style="margin-left: 4vw;">
  <li>Restrictions on public meetings and associations were removed.</li>
  <li>Soviets were set up. In industrial areas, factory committees were formed which began questioning the way the industrialists ran their factories.</li>
  <li>Soldier’s committees were formed in the army.</li>
  <li>The Provisional Government saw its power declining and Bolshevik influence grew. It decided to take stern measures against the spreading discontent. It resisted attempts by workers to run factories and arrested leaders. Peasants and socialists revolutionary leaders pressed for a redistribution of land. Land committees were formed and peasants seized land between July and September 1917.</li>
</ol>
